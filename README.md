This code implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) using a Transformer architecture to solve the 1D heat equation. The heat equation is discretized using finite differences, and a Gaussian initial condition is imposed. The solution is computed using solve_ivp for ground truth. The Transformer-based PINN is trained with finite-difference approximations for derivatives** instead of autograd, enforcing both the **PDE residual loss** and the **initial condition loss**. The model is trained using **Adam optimizer** on GPU, and predictions are generated over the full space-time domain. The final results compare the **true solution vs. PINN-predicted solution** using heatmaps and sequential time-marching predictions. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning to approximate **PDE solutions efficiently without explicit numerical solvers**.
